# Bookmarklets
Useful and some useless bookmarklets I use
I did not create all of these, only some of them are mine.

To activate these bookmarklets, either paste the javascript code into a bookmark url in google chrome, or download the ShortKeys Chrome Extension, create a new shortcut, select javascript execution, and then paste the code in the shortcut settings.

If you use ShortKeys, you can put set the bookmarklet to a keyboard shortcut, and use it on any browser.
